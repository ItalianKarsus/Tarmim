"They seem splendid: you must be quite the teacher."

"I am flattered, woman. What is your urgency? What is your ask?"

"What is my offer, you mean." the elven songstress purred. She was close- too close. The mage watched her eyes, then her shoulders, fearing she may have a hidden knife, or an accomplice close at hand. "You are a mage, after all. And I've come across a unique opportunity for you. A book of powerful spells, which I'd be happy to part with, for the right price. Surely, a man of the Black Network wants not for foes... imagine what an edge this could be for you."

The mage chuckled. He was starting to feel quite alarmed.

"A book of powerful spells, you say. And what price would it command, if you were to have your way?"

"I'd ask for my weight in gold, but that would be too little, wouldn't it? So perhaps yours... or, if you'll allow me a sinful thought, ours both, together." she purred. "Yes, I would like that the most."

"I swear, I am not carrying my weight in gulders."

"But surely you must have gems. Enchanted by a sorcerer, over four days, worth a small fortune each..."

"You're overbold, singer," he raised an eyebrow, a quiet note of anger rising in his voice "to listen in on our conversation and so frely weigh in, after admitting to something a lesser sorcerer would slay over- if as you say, I serve the Black Network."

"Does it bother you I do not cower, fawn, and swoon at your puissance, like humans do? I would be wealthy and know excitement. Why else mingle with despoilers of the Moonsea?"

"The follies of men and elves, good woman, are without end."

She narrowed her eyes.

"So are you just teasing me, are you not interested in buying?"

"I didn't say that." he hissed. "If it is quite as powerful as you imply, I can part with about twelve hundred gulders..."

"What? That's insulting, you little-!" she gasped, her cheeks quickly rising in angry red.
